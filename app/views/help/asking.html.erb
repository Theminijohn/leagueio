        League I/O is for professional and enthusiast League of Legends Players,
        people who love the Game and want to contribute to the Community. If your
        Questions generally cover:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>a League of Legends related Problem</li>
        <li>practical, answerable problems</li>
        <li>a minimum understanding of the Problem</li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      <p>… then you’re in the right place to ask your question!</p>

      <p>
        Please look around to see if your question has been asked before.
        Questions which are too broad, unclear, or primarily opinion-based may
        be put on hold by the community until they are improved.

        <h1><span class="fui-tag"></span> What types of questions should I avoid asking?</h1>
      </div>

      <p>First, make sure that your question is <b>on-topic for this site</b>.</p>

      <p>
        You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual
        problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the
        usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.
      </p>


      <p>
        Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire
        book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to
        participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking
        here. However, if your motivation is “I would like others to
        explain ______ to me”, then you are probably OK.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed,
          <i>avoid</i> asking subjective questions where …
        </b>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
        <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
        <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
        <li>you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
        <li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      <p><b>Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”. All subjective questions are expected to be <i>constructive</i></b>. What does that mean? Constructive subjective questions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”</li>
        <li>tend to have long, not short, answers</li>
        <li>have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone</li>
        <li>invite sharing experiences over opinions</li>
        <li>insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references</li>
        <li>are more than just mindless social fun</li>

        <h1><span class="fui-tag"></span> Why and how are some questions deleted?</h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        Questions that are <b>extremely off topic</b>, or of very low quality,
        may be removed at the discretion of the community and moderators.

        Over time, closed questions that are not useful as signpoints to other
        questions may also be removed, as well as questions which have no
        significant activity over a very long period after being asked. If you
        want to improve a question to keep it from being deleted, click the
        edit button beneath it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, any answer that accumulates enough offensive or spam
        flags will be automatically deleted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          Users can delete their own questions if the question has zero answers
        </b>
      </p>


      <p>Simply click the delete link underneath the question.</p>

      <p>
        Questions can also be deleted by the community. Moderators can delete
        any question, and users with sufficient reputation can cast delete votes
        on closed questions. It takes 3 votes, minimum, to delete a closed
        question. However, the number of delete votes required scales to the
        number of votes on the question and all its answers.

    <section id="tags">
      <div class="help_topic_header">
        <h1><span class="fui-tag"></span> What are tags, and how should I use them?</h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question.
        Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they will be able
        to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tags can also be used to help you identify questions that are
        interesting or relevant to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking on a tag below a question brings you to a page that shows all
        questions within that tag. You also see a description of what the tag is
        and how it should be applied on League I/O (since sometimes the tag name
        is a common word that has a broad meaning in the real world but a very
        particular, narrow meaning on this site.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Each question <b>may only contain 5 tags at a maximum</b>, so choose the ones
        that best describe your question.
      </p>

      <h3>Re-tagging</h3>

      <p>
        As part of the editing process, users may
        suggest edits or directly edit the tags of a question if they feel a
        certain tag was used inappropriately or that the question is missing a tag.
      </p>

      <p>You should re-tag questions when:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are adding valuable information to the question by doing so
        </li>
        <li>
          You are replacing obscure or difficult to understand tags with
          well-known and popular tags that are appropriate for the question.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      <h4>Should I use tags in titles?</h4>

      <p>
        You should not <em>force</em> a tag into your title. Because the tags
        appear below the question and tags are indexed by search engines along
        with the content of your question, you can trust that other people will
        be able to find your question based on tags they follow or search for.
        Additionally, tags appear on the question page, so other people will
        take them into account when answering your question.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em><strong>Avoid</strong></em> inserting tags into titles in any of
        the following formats:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>[tag]: [question title]</li>
        <li>[question title] -- [tag] [tag] [tag]</li>
        <li>[question title] in [tag]</li>
        <li>[tag] [tag] [question title] [tag] [tag] [tag]</li>
        <li>[tag] [tag] [tag] [tag] [tag] [tag] [tag] [tag]</li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      <p>
        <b>
          The only time you should use tags in your title is when they are
          organic to the conversational tone of the title.
        </b>

        <h1><span class="fui-tag"></span> What should I do when someone answers my question?</h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first thing you should do when someone answers your question is
        vote on it, like any other user does. Vote up answers that are helpful
        and well-researched, and vote down answers that are not. Other users
        will also vote on answers to your question.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the author of the question, you have an additional option:
        accepting an answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem.
      </p>

      <p><b>To accept an answer:</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Choose one answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem.</li>
        <li>To mark an answer as accepted, click on the check mark beside the answer to toggle it from greyed out to filled in.</li>
        <li>You may change which answer is accepted, or simply un-accept the answer, at any time.</li>
      </ol>

      <br>

      <p>
        Accepting an answer is not mandatory; do not feel compelled to accept
        the first answer you receive. Wait until you receive an answer that
        answers your question well.

          We’d love to help you. To <b>improve your chances</b> of getting an
          answer, here are some tips:
        </p>

        <h5>Search, and research</h5>

        <p>
          Have you <b>thoroughly searched for an answer</b> <i>before</i>
          asking your question? Sharing your research helps everyone.
          Tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs.
          This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself,
          it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps
          you get a more specific and relevant answer!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Be on-topic</h5>

        <p>
          Our community is defined by a specific set of topics that you can
          view in the help center; please stick to those topics and avoid asking
          for opinions or open-ended discussion.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Be specific</h5>

        <p>
          If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you
          give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Make it relevant to others</h5>

        <p>
          We like to help as many people at a time as we can. Make it clear how
          your question is relevant to more people than just you, and more of us
          will be interested in your question and willing to look into it.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Keep an open mind</h5>

        <p>
          The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted,
          but that doesn’t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn’t always
          possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to
          explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don’t agree with
          you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear,
          remember: <b>we’re just trying to help</b>.
